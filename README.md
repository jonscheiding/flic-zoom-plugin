# Flic Button Zoom plugin

A plugin for the Flic Mac app that allows it to toggle audio and video during a Zoom meeting.

## Installation

Clone the repo to `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.shortcutlabs.FlicMac`

> Note: you cannot clone the repo somwhere else and then symlink it. The FlicMac app doesn't follow plugin symlinks.

You should then see Zoom as an option under User-Supplied Plugins when setting up a new action for your Flic button.
